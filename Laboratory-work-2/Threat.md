This may lead to a denial of service attack against Web Server or an elevation of privilege attack against Web Server or an information disclosure by Web Server. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach. |

Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.                                                                                                                                                         |

Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the external entity.                                                                                                                                                      |

Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.                                                                                                             |

Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives. Even parameterized data can be manipulated by a skilled and determined attacker.                                              |

Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store.                                                                                                                                              |
